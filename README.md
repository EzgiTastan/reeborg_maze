# Maze Solver with Reeborg's World (in Python)

This Python project aims to solve maze problem using a classical one: [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)
In this website, you can experience a virtual environment where users can program a robot to navigate through mazes.

## Lost in a Maze!
Reeborg, the robot, finds itself in a dark maze with a depleted flashlight battery. </br>
The challenge is to guide Reeborg to the maze's exit using an if/elif/else statement logic. </br>
Reeborg must follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right whenever possible, moving straight ahead if it can't turn right, and turning left as a last resort.



## What you need to know
Well, first, this website is amazing. I've used it for approximately 10 times while teaching a kid Python. Since it is interactive and it enables you to see the result of your code step by step, it is definitely one of the best websites that I would suggest to anyone who teaches python.
</br>
Other than that,
The functions move() and turn_left() are already built-in functions. You can _and should_ define other functions by using those ones. More built-in functions are: front_is_clear(), wall_in_front(), right_is_clear(), wall_on_right(), and at_goal().

## Usage
To use this maze solver program:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project directory in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
4. Run the `main.py` script.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Reeborg's World for providing the interactive programming environment used in this project.
